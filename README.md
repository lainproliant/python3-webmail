python3-webmail
===============

A high-level webmail library built atop imaplib and pyzmail.

This library will be the basis of a series of command line tools for accessing, composing, and sending email using IMAP and SMTP.

NOTE
----
This project is still under construction.  These tools are currently only useful for reading email and handling attachments.
SMTP and editor interoperability are coming soon!
